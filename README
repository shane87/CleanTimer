This is a simple timer app that I am starting for my wife. She has some
strange cleaning habits, and sometimes she gets sidetracked/mixed up. So
this app is designed to (hopefully) help her stay focused.

DISCLAIMER: This app is being co-designed by my wife, and with her express
consent, and for fun!! So nobody start a #cancel campaign against me for being
mean to my wife!!
